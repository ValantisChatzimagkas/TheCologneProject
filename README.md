# TheCologneProject
This project was a collaboration project between THOMAS MORE COLLEGE and the Cologne University and it involved the Electronics department
of both universities. It is a monitoring system which involves a raspberry pi, a raspberry pi camera and a PIR motion sensor. 
This system receives an interrupt via the PIR sensor , next the raspberry pi automatically will take a picture using the camera , 
after this step the photo will go through face detection and find how many faces are there and last it will upload the timestamp 
and the number of faces found in a local host server which has a database.This has also been implemented for a remote server as well.
